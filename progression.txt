Space Invaders Progress

- Display ship on screen
- Ship can move based on user input
- Moving objects do not pass through walls
- Ship can shoot missiles
- Alien can shoot missiles every 2 seconds
- The missiles can collide with moving objects
	- Colliding with the ship will reduce the ship's number of lives
	- Ship's position will be reset to the initial starting position
- A scoreboard has been created
	- Will handle all score and lives related ui
- Game score updated based on alien's score
- Alien can gradually move toward the player
    - Every time it reaches a wall, it goes down and increases its speed
- Aliens can move as a line
    - The rightmost and leftmost aliens are both identified
    - The box that encapsulates the line are made based on the distance between Right and Left
    - Every alien reverses directions when the box reaches the wall boundaries
        - The box is then adjusted according to the Left and Right aliens
    - Randomly chosen alien shoots every 2 seconds

//// Ideas for movement handling
    ///    - Have a swarm class that holds all the aliens
    ///        - Could also hold an arraylist of composite AlienGroups
    ///    - To update the movement, swarm will loop through its collection and call the update method on every alien
    ///        - Have a big rectangle encapsulate the entire swarm of aliens
    ///        - When either the right or left sides of the box touch the walls, every alien will be told to change
    ///          directions and move down by a certain amount
    ///        - Gonna need a new collideWith() for swarm (idk how to do it yet)
    ///        - Select a random alien to shoot every few seconds if there is no alien right in front of it
    ///             - Every line might need to select an alien
    ///        - How to check though???
    ///             - if a 2d array is used, then indexing the position in front of the alien and checking if that alien
    ///               is dead will do


Things to do:






------ All of the things are done --------

Things to fix:
- The wall collisions
- Swarm still has bugs
    - Just the wall collisions
- Might need to make the speed of the aliens increase as there are lesser aliens
